BP Project for Analyze Data Retention and Destruction.

Opportunity
We wish to implement efficient and effective processes to support our POPIA policies to ensure that we are compliant

Current Situation
* An internal project was initiated in 2021 to identify what will be needed to ensure compliance with POPIA. The impacts of the act were analysed and documented
* 2 policies were drafted to address the needs identified: Data Privacy and Retention and Destruction
* The policies have not been implemented yet as the processes needed to adhere to the policies have not been defined yet

Expected Outcome
•End-to-end processes that will service the needs of the Data Privacy policy and Retention
and Destruction policy
•Defined people and technology needs that may also need to be implemented to support
the processes i.e. will new tools be needed, what training (and for who) will be needed to
adopt the processes?
